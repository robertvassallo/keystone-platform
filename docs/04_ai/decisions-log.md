# Decisions Log

Lightweight ADRs (Architecture Decision Records). One entry per non-obvious decision. Recent first.

## When to add an entry

- A choice that overrides a default in this template.
- A trade-off where the chosen path isn't obviously the best — record why.
- A decision whose context will be lost if not written down ("we picked X because of an incident in Q2").
- A waived dependency advisory or temporary workaround that needs to be revisited.

## When NOT to add an entry

- Bug fixes — the commit message captures it.
- Refactors that don't change behaviour.
- Trivial dependency upgrades.

## Entry template

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — Title (short, declarative)

**Status:** accepted | superseded by <link>

**Context:** What is the situation? What constraints exist?

**Decision:** What we're going to do.

**Consequences:** What changes as a result. Positive and negative.

**Alternatives considered:** Other options we looked at and why we passed.

**Revisit when:** What signal would make us reopen this? (e.g., "tenant count > 1000",
"if the bundle exceeds 300 KB gzipped", "in 90 days").
```

## 2026-04-24 — Adopt Django + Next.js + Postgres as the canonical stack

**Status:** accepted

**Context:** Setting up a starter template for full-stack web / dashboard projects. Need a stack that's productive for the dashboard / SaaS shape, with mature ORM, type safety on both ends, and a clean separation between server-rendered marketing pages and interactive dashboards.

**Decision:** Django (5.x, REST Framework) + Next.js (15.x, App Router) + Postgres (16.x). Python 3.12 + Node 22 LTS. pnpm + uv as package managers.

**Consequences:**
- Two languages to maintain (Python on the API, TS on the frontend).
- Strong defaults: Django auth / admin / ORM are mature; Next.js App Router gives us RSC + streaming.
- Shared types via OpenAPI generation, not via direct imports.
- Deploy story split — backend container vs Vercel-style frontend.

**Alternatives considered:**
- **Full-stack TypeScript (NestJS + Prisma + Next.js):** Single language, but loses Django's batteries-included productivity for admin / forms / migrations.
- **FastAPI + Next.js:** Faster API request handling, but no built-in admin / migrations / auth — we'd build a lot of plumbing.
- **Laravel / Rails:** Mature, similar tradeoffs to Django; team familiarity favoured Django.

**Revisit when:** Team composition shifts toward TS-only, or Django's RSC story changes meaningfully.
